 ## current developers
| Role | Name | Github |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Components | Shane Austrie | https://github.com/Austrie/ |
| Research | Henry Bowe | https://github.com/hleejr |
| Front end| Erick W Espinoza | https://github.com/WesleyEspinoza |
| The help | Maximo Hinojosa | https://github.com/mhinojosa24 |

**Components**
Components role will be reponsible for creating the components needed for the entire project. That includes making sure the componets all work well together and can be implemented by the front end role. `requires a decent understanding of react and its component system`

**Research** *Document of all compiled research: [Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i6V86Cm12YB32jymnxT9eqdVQBDbn7z6xlkZbePHCRw/edit?usp=sharing)*
The research role will handle all of the research we will need for the project. This include getting a list of at least 4 Major historical events. If just 4 make sure they are the ones with the biggest impact. A deep dive into all of them, you will make sure all of the events are neatly oraginized in a Doc and in choronolical order for easy implemetation. If done early you can be moved to The help role(see below) `requires great levels of detail and orientation`

**Front end**
The front end role will take charge of the asthetic of the page making sure everything looks nice, you will be working closely with research and component roles. You are incharge of the Wireframe before the component can start their works, but all roles are expected to take part in the wireframe design. `requires an understanding of front end and a keen eye for what looks good.`

**The help**
The help's role is to help anyone that is falling behind making sure we finish the project on time. You will start with helping the front end with wireframes, once wireframes are done move over to the research, from there if any other role requests your assistance it will be cricual you help. `requires a little bit of everything`


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
