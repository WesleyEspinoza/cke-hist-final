The Equal Pay Act is a labor law that prohibits gender-based wage discrimination in the United States signed by President Kennedy in 1963 as an amendment to the Fair Labor Standards Act 

Wage Gap
Women made up a quarter of the American workforce by the early 20th century, but they were traditionally paid far less than men, even in cases where they performed the same job. In some states, female workers were also forced to contend with laws that restricted their working hours or prohibited them from working at night.

In 1942, for example, the National War Labor Board endorsed policies to provide equal pay in instances where women were directly replacing male workers.

in 1945, the U.S. Congress introduced the Women’s Equal Pay Act, which would have made it illegal to pay women less than men for work of “comparable quality and quantity.” The measure failed to pass, however, and little progress was made on pay equity during the 1950s. By 1960, women still earned less than two-thirds of what their male counterparts were paid.

Esther Peterson, head of the Women’s Bureau of the Department of Labor, former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt Representatives Katharine St. George and Edith Green were at the head of the charge for a bill

Despite the opposition of powerful business groups such as the Chamber of Commerce and the Retail Merchants Association, Congress passed the Equal Pay Act in 1963 as an amendment to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.
